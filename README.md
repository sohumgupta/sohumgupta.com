### Original Theme
I originally had a "picnic" theme on my website, but while it was quite cute, it wasn't very professional and I didn't update it. Also, I had created it in pure vanilla HTML/CSS, which was quite grueling and, quite frankly, annoying to deal with. So at the beginning of my sophomore year at Brown, I decided it needed an update.

### My Current Theme
Now, I'm much more satisfied with my website. It's not perfect by any means (especially on mobile), but I think it feel much more professional, and, because I used React to write it and switched my hosting service to Firebase, I am much more on top of keeping it updated. I hope you like it, because I spent a lot of time on it :)
