				<p>
				As you probably know by now, I'm <mark class="importanttext">Sohum Gupta.</mark> And as you also probably know by now, I'm currently a first-year student at <mark class="importanttext">Brown University</mark> studying <mark class="importanttext">applied mathematics and computer science.</mark> I'm on track to graduate in spring 2022 with a joint-concentration in APMA-CS. My professional interests mostly lie in front-end, such as <mark class="importanttext">web design</mark> and <mark class="importanttext">UI/UX design,</mark> but I am also interested in the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computer vision. I enjoy honing my skills in web design, as well as in creating computer-generated art using open-source libraries such as Javascript's p5.js libraries. </p>

				<p>
				Most of my computer science experience comes from the classes I have taken (either at Brown or in high school), including my proficiency in languages such as <mark class="importanttext">C#, Java, MySQL, PHP, and Python,</mark> but some of my skills are also self-taught through personal projects, such as my proficiency in <mark class="importanttext">HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.</mark> </p>

				<p>
				I attended the <mark class="importanttext">Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (IMSA)</mark> in Aurora, IL, for my sophomore through senior years of high school. At IMSA, I was an executive board member on my school's class club, which, over a span of three years, fully funded our Senior Promâ€”which we held at the Willis Tower! I was also a board member on my school's newspaper, <em>The Acronym</em>. On top of this, I was a Community Developer, which meant that I planned and held programs for a residential hall of about 100 students, and I was the president and founder of a Graphic Design club, which was an organization that other clubs on campus could outsource graphic design work to. </p>
